        previous status code is reused from cache. Return HTTP
        error codes and not just 1 or 0 status code. Disabled
        GET request and used solely HEAD.

2004-10-12 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub ReadLinksBasic): 1.132 Clarified regex by
        introducing variables `urlset' and `quote'. Added one
        more debug 5 level print.
        (sub ReadLinksBasic): 1.132 Fixed mismatches like
        http://example.org/links.html&gt => http://example.org/links.html

2004-09-11  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (PrintHtmlDoc): typos corrected in manual page.

2004-08-29 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub XlatWordMarkup): 1.131 Changed [ \t] to [\s]
        which is more general. Code now uses more readable s{}{}gx and
        new variable $prefix.

2004-08-12 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub ReadLinksBasic): 1.130 Incorrect regexp to find links.
        Added \s to exclude characters that do not belong to address.

2004-06-28 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (Help): 1.129 Added more documentation to
        --language option.

2004-03-30   Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl
        Extra newlines were removed from whole program. Sort of clean up work.
        (CssData): Change word-small from 0.8 to 0.7, because
        if the web page is zoomed 200% or more the font with 0.8 looks
        too big.
        (DoLine): Corrected bug, where right hand angle bracked and text
        after it in tag #URL-AS-IS was not outputted. The regexp must
        include &gt;, not exclude it in output.

2004-02-11 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub IsHeading): 1.122 Wrong regexp did not
        recognize heading without numbering. "Like This", but
        wanter "1.1 Like This".
        (HandleCommandLineArgs): 1.123 Options --css-code-bg and
        --css-code-bg2 has mistakenly taken option `:s'.
        Removed.

2004-02-06 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (CssData() => .shade-note-attrib): Added
        `font-family' and `font-size'. It is not 0.8 smaller.
        (sub InitArgs): 1.121 Fixed local Hash() function.
        Always list @values was returned and then assignef to
        scalar. That caused the count of members. Now return
        single scalar. This fixes E.g <TITLE>1</TITLE> problem.

2004-02-03 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub XlatTag2html): 1.121 Special HTML
        entities that had number at the end, like &sup3;
        were translated incorrectly as &amp;sup3;. Fixed.

2004-02-02 Mon  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub DoLineUserTags): 1.121 Added debug.
        (sub XlatTag2htmlSpecial): 1.121 Added debug.
        (sub XlatTag2html): 1.121 Added debug.

        - Added many new lines of debug code all over the program.
        (Getopt::Long): 1.120 Option --Auto-detect
        mistakenly had `:s' option request which ate the file
        name following the option.
        (sub IsHTML): 1.120 Searching first 100 for <HTML> is
        too much. Reduced to 10 lines.

2004-01-24 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub Main): 1.117 Hash('option') CAll did not check
        values correctly. It always returned try, so all user's command
        line options were cleared. The Hash-function must not return
        'undef' or any other values, because it is stored to an array.
        The only correct value to return is empty list (). This fix
        corrects e.g. option --name-uniq.

2003-12-14  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (XlatDirectives): Typo corrected
        if  $line = /\S/ =>  if  $line =~ /\S/

2003-12-05 Fri    Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (XlatDirectives): 1.116 Incorrectly required
        that all #t2html-<directive> tags start from left. Regexp
        included '^\s*'. The anchor is now removed.

2003-11-11  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (XlatDirectives): If the directove line was
        empty line plain '#t2html-comment' the line was not
        stripped. Now fixed. No directives are left in text.

2003-09-26 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (unless ( /\S/ )): 1.115 --script-file
        no longer dies on error if file was not found.
        New option --css-file to import external

2003-09-21  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (AcceptUrl($)): 'foo' excluded also valid
        links like 'foorum'. Fixed by aadding \b.

2003-08-19 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub ReadLinksBasic): 1.113 the BASE value
        included extra /, which made all links invalid. Now regexp
        correctly removed only trailing slash. Ignore `mailto'
        HREFS.

2003-08-17 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl
        (Help): New user option #INCLUDE-<url>. With this is is
        possible to include other files into this current one. Either
        via http://address or just plain files. The included portion
        is copied to the point verbatim. No translations happen.
        (sub RemoveHTMLaround): 1.109 New.
        (sub UrlInclude): 1.109 New.
        (sub EnvExpand): 1.112 New.

2003-08-12 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (CssData): 1.107 Changed colors to dimmer.
        [samp.word] is no longer `blue', but lighter  #4C9CD4 + bold.
        [shade-note-attrib] is no longer #E0E0F0 but lighter #E5ECF3.
        (CheckModuleLWP): Removed.
        (CheckModuleLinkExtractor): Removed.
        (ReadLinksLinkExtractor): New. If HTML::LinkExtractor is around,
        use it and skip program's own imperfect link extracting routine.
        (TestDriverLinkExtractor): 1.108 New.

2003-08-03 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub GetFile): 1.106 HTTP get did not preserve newlined.
        Added for-loop to split().
        (sub ReadLinks): 1.106 Whole logic rewritten. There were serious
        URL link reading errors in this whole function. The current
        implementation is not very robust, but should be adequate for simple
        external links (http://). Added support for detecting local
        'A HREF=local.html' links by prepending BASE to them.

2003-07-31 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub HandleCommandLineArgs): 1.103 Added empty HOME
        test.
        (Top level;): 1.103 Added qw($HOME), to satisfy Windows users,
        who do not have that set. Bug reported by vimma@jippii.fi
        (sub Help): 1.103 Documented new option --button-heading-top.
        Added new topic `BUGS'.
        (sub HandleCommandLineArgs): 1.103 New option `button-heading-top'.
        (sub MakeHeadingHtml): 1.103 Added support for
        $OPT_HEADING_TOP_BUTTON (The feature was previously commented out).
        (sub HandleCommandLineArgs): 1.103 --Version option now prints
        to stdout instead of stderr. In addition, print $PROGRAM_NAME;
        full path.
        (sub MakeHeadingHtml): 1.104 Now the [toc] link respects
        the --Language setting.

2003-07-22 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (sub MakeToc): 1.102 Simplified FRAMESET main() html
        file, so that there is no CSS any more, because it is only needed
        in the xxxx-body.html file.

2003-05-02 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        RELEASED: 2003.0502

        prefixed with a minus character, like -http://this.is/example.html

2003-01-12 Sun  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (DoLine): 1.97 Corrected #URL-AS-IS regexp. Do not
        count in the last character `>', like in <#URL-AS-IS-this.html>

2003-01-02 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * t2html.pl (MakeHeadingHtml): 1.97 If --as-is option is active,

        * t2html.pl (HtmlFixes): 1.94 Remove P-tag just before
        <UL> and <OL>. Not needed.
        (MakeHeadingHtml): 1.94 Added special character handling to header
        string. Call `XlatTag2htmlSpecial'.

        1.2em to 0.7em. The font is not that loud any more.

2002-08-31 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        * examples/: The other test files (2, 3) were not

        defaul CSS style. Most useful in #t2html:: code column 12
        directives.

        in whitespace before newline. This was incorrect. There
        can be zero spac before newline. Fixed. In layout, this
        causes extra newline just before CODE column 12.

2002-08-30  Jari Aalto   <jari.aalto@cante.net>

        Example 4 was not generated correctly. Bash gor mixed up
        with the embedded single quotes in definition
        --css-code='(?:Note|Notice)' => reduced to simple
        --css-code=Note: which does not use single quotes. This
        is only a problem inside bash command file, which uses `eval'.

        are ignore '\"!?;,.(<> before superscript.

        * t2html.pl (HtmlFixes): Whent the new feature --css-code-note
        was put to a test (big documnet), it had serious flaws in
        regexps (too greedy). Fixed. Now coloring should be ok.
        ADDEd NEW FEATURES. It is now posisble to say exactly what kind of
        table redering is wanted. See manual for directive #t2html::

        * t2html.pl (XlatHtml2tag): Added more conversion: Swedish,
        Norweigian, German.
        (MakeHeadingName): With foreign languages, like in Finnish the
        Heading may contain non-7bit characters and the NAME tag
        generated is composed form &auml;, which is not good.
        Not substitutes &auml; with simple 'a'. Same for
        Swedish, Norweigian, and German.
        (UpdateHeaderArray): Adde dmore debug. The substitution
        removed crucial & and ; characters that delimit special

        (HandleCommandLineArgs): OUTPUT_AUTOMATIC (--Out) must be turned
        also on if user supplies --Out-dir.

        in CSS handling (IE 5.5). Corrected code that added semicolon
        at the end of SIZE and FONT styles. (added double ;;)

        download ): Added CHANGELOG printing from CVS.
        Rewote teh example perl commands. Had to copy files from
        doc/examples/ to doc/html directory, because otherwise
        it is not possible to locally browse doc/html/index.html with
        the example links in the page. Updated  NEWS section to mention
        about new #T2HTML features. Chnages CPAN text to say, that
        it no longer the primary source - warning, that the CPAN
        file may not be up to date. Removed copyright year from the end
        of file.
