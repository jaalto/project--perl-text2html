2004-10-18  Jari Aalto  <jari dot aalto A T cante dt net>

        Extra newlines were removed from whole program. Sort of clean up work.
        (CssData): Change word-small from 0.8 to 0.7, because
        if the web page is zoomed 200% or more the font with 0.8 looks
        too big.
        (DoLine): Corrected bug, where right hand angle bracked and text
        after it in tag #URL-AS-IS was not outputted. The regexp must
        include &gt;, not exclude it in output.

2004-02-11 Wed  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>

        * t2html.pl (sub IsHeading): 1.122 Wrong regexp did not
        recognize heading without numbering. "Like This", but
        wanter "1.1 Like This".
        (HandleCommandLineArgs): 1.123 Options --css-code-bg and
        --css-code-bg2 has mistakenly taken option `:s'.
        Removed.

2004-02-06 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>

        * t2html.pl (CssData() => .shade-note-attrib): Added
        `font-family' and `font-size'. It is not 0.8 smaller.
        (sub InitArgs): 1.121 Fixed local Hash() function.
        Always list @values was returned and then assignef to
        scalar. That caused the count of members. Now return
        single scalar. This fixes E.g <TITLE>1</TITLE> problem.

2004-02-03 Tue  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>

        * t2html.pl (sub XlatTag2html): 1.121 Special HTML
        entities that had number at the end, like &sup3;

        mistakenly had `:s' option request which ate the file
        name following the option.
        (sub IsHTML): 1.120 Searching first 100 for <HTML> is
        too much. Reduced to 10 lines.

2004-01-24 Sat  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>

        * t2html.pl (sub Main): 1.117 Hash('option') CAll did not check
        values correctly. It always returned try, so all user's command
        line options were cleared. The Hash-function must not return
        'undef' or any other values, because it is stored to an array.
        The only correct value to return is empty list (). This fix
        corrects e.g. option --name-uniq.

2003-12-14  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>

        * t2html.pl (XlatDirectives): Typo corrected

        included '^\s*'. The anchor is now removed.

2003-11-11  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>

        * t2html.pl (XlatDirectives): If the directove line was
        empty line plain '#t2html-comment' the line was not
        stripped. Now fixed. No directives are left in text.

2003-09-26 Fri  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>

        * t2html.pl (unless ( /\S/ )): 1.115 --script-file
        no longer dies on error if file was not found.
        New option --css-file to import external

2003-09-21  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>

        * t2html.pl (AcceptUrl($)): 'foo' excluded also valid
        links like 'foorum'. Fixed by aadding \b.

        * t2html.pl (sub ReadLinksBasic): 1.113 the BASE value
        included extra /, which made all links invalid. Now regexp

        (sub ReadLinks): 1.106 Whole logic rewritten. There were serious
        URL link reading errors in this whole function. The current
        implementation is not very robust, but should be adequate for simple
        external links (http://). Added support for detecting local
        'A HREF=local.html' links by prepending BASE to them.

2003-07-31 Thu  Jari Aalto  <jari aalto A T cante dt net>
