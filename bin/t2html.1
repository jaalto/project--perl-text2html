.IX Title "T2HTML 1"
.TH T2HTML 1 "2007-09-18" "perl v5.8.8" "Perl Text to HTML Converter"
.SH "NAME"
t2html.pl \- Simple text to HTML converter. Relies on text indentation rules.
.SH "README"
.IX Header "README"
Convert pure text files into nice looking, possibly framed, \s-1HTML\s0 pages.
.PP
\&\fBRequirements for the input ascii files\fR
.PP
The file must be written in Technical Format, whose layout is described in
the this manual. Basicly the idea is simple and there are only two heading
levels: one at column 0 and the other at column 4 (halfway between the tab
width). Standard text starts at column 8 (the position after pressed tab\-key).
.PP
The idea of technical format is that each column represents different
rendering layout in the generated \s-1HTML\s0. There is no special markup needed
in the text file, so you can use the text version as a master copy of a \s-1FAQ\s0
etc. Bullets, numbered lists, word emphasis and quotation etc. can
expressed in natural way.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1HTML\s0 description\fR
.PP
The generated \s-1HTML\s0 includes embedded Cascading Style Sheet 2 (\s-1CSS2\s0) and a
small piece of Java code. The \s-1CSS2\s0 is used to colorize the page loyout and
to define suitable printing font sizes. The generated \s-1HTML\s0 also takes an
approach to support \s-1XHTML\s0. See page http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
where the backward compatibility recommendations are outlined:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    Legal HTML          XHTML requires
\&    <P>                 <p> ..</p>
\&    <BR>                <br></br>
\&    <HR>                <hr></hr>
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1XHTML\s0 does not support fragment identifiers #foo, with the \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR element,
but uses \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR instead. For backward compatibility both elements are
defined:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    < ..name="tag">     Is now <.. name="tag" id="tag">
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1NOTE:\s0 This program was never designed to be used for \s-1XHTML\s0 and the
strict \s-1XHTML\s0 validity is not to be expected.
.PP
\&\fBMotivation\fR
.PP
The easiest format to write large documents, like FAQs, is text. A text
file offers WysiWyg editing and it can be turned easily into \s-1HTML\s0 format.
Text files are easily maintained and there is no requirements for special
text editors. Any text editor like notepad, vi, Emacs can be used to
maintain the documents.
.PP
Text files are also the only sensible format if documents are kept under
version control like \s-1RCS\s0, \s-1CVS\s0, \s-1SVN\s0, Arch, Perforce, ClearCase. They can be
asily compared with diff and patches can be easily received and sent to
them.
.PP
To help maintining large documents, there is also available an
\&\fIEmacs\fR minor mode, package called \fItinytf.el\fR, which offers text
fontification with colors, Indentation control, bullet filling,
heading renumbering, word markup, syntax highlighting etc.
See project http://freshmeat.net/projects/emacs\-tiny\-tools
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
To convert text file into \s-1HTML:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    t2html.pl [options] file.txt > file.html
.Ve
.PP
In addition to making \s-1HTML\s0 pages, program includes feature to check broken
links and report them in \fIegrep \-n\fR like fashion:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    t2html.pl --Link-check-single --quiet file.txt
.Ve
.PP
To check links from multiple pages and cache good links to separate file,
use \fB\-\-Link\-cache\fR option. The next link check will run much faster
because cached valid links will not be fetched again. At regular intervals
delete the link cache file to force complete check.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    t2html.pl --Link-check-single --Link-cache ~/tmp/link.cache \e
\&              --quiet file.txt
.Ve
.PP
In case there are need for slides, is is possible to plit big document into
pieces according to toplevel headings:
.PP

.IP "\fB\-\-disclaimer\-file\fR \s-1FILE\s0" 4
.IX Item "--disclaimer-file FILE"
The text that appears at the footer is read from this file. If not given
the default copyright text is added. Options \f(CW\*(C`\-\-quiet\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-simple\*(C'\fR suppress disclaimers.
.IP "\fB\-\-document \s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--document FILE"
\&\fBName\fR of the document or filename. You could list all
alternative URLs to the document with this option.
.IP "\fB\-\-email \-e \s-1EMAIL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--email -e EMAIL"
The contact address of the author of the document. Must be pure email
address with no \*(L"<\*(R" and \*(L">\*(R" characters included. Eg.
\&\fB\-\-email foo@example.com\fR
.Sp
.Vb 2

.IX Item "--t2html-tags"
Allow processing embedded #T2HTML\-<tag> directives inside file. See full
explanation by reading topic \f(CW\*(C`EMBEDDED DIRECTIVES INSIDE TEXT\*(C'\fR. By
default, you do not need to to supply this option \- it is \*(L"on\*(R" by default.
.Sp
To disregard embedded directives in text file, supply \*(L"no\*(R" option:
\&\fB\-\-not2html\-tags\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-title \s-1STR\s0\fR \fB\-t \s-1STR\s0\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-\-url \s-1URL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--url URL"
.PP
Location of the \s-1HTML\s0 file. When \fB\-\-document\fR gave the name, this gives the
location. This information is printed at the Footer.
.Sh "Html: Navigation urls"
.IX Subsection "Html: Navigation urls"
.IP "\fB\-\-base \s-1URL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--base URL"
\&\s-1URL\s0 location of the \s-1HTML\s0 file in the \fBdestination site\fR where it will be
put available. This option is needed only if the document is hosted on a
\&\s-1FTP\s0 server (rare, but possible). A \s-1FTP\s0 server based document cannot use
Table Of Contents links (fragment \fI#tag\fR identifiers) unless \s-1HTML\s0 tag \s-1BASE\s0
is also defined.
.Sp
The argument can be full \s-1URL\s0 to the document:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    --base ftp://ftp.example.com/file.html
\&    --base ftp://ftp.example.com/
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-button\-heading\-top\fR" 4
.IX Item "--button-heading-top"
Add additional \fB[toc]\fR navigation button to the end of each heading. This
may be useful in long non-framed \s-1HTML\s0 files.
.IP "\fB\-\-button\-top \s-1URL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--button-top URL"
Buttons are placed at the top of document in order: [previous][top][next]
and \fI\-\-button\-*\fR options define the URLs.
.Sp
If \s-1URL\s0 is string \fInone\fR then no button is inserted. This may be handy if
the buttons are defined by a separate program. And example using Perl:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    #!/usr/bin/perl
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    my $top   = "index.html";             # set defaults
\&    my $prev  = "none";
\&    my $next  = "none";
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    # ... somewhere $prev or $next may get set, or then not
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    qx(t2html.pl --button-top "$top" --button-prev "$prev" --button-next "$next" ...);
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    # End of sample program
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-button\-prev \s-1URL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--button-prev URL"
\&\s-1URL\s0 to go to previous document or string \fInone\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-button\-next \s-1URL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--button-next URL"
\&\s-1URL\s0 to go to next document or string \fInone\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-reference tag=value\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reference tag=value"
You can add any custom references (tags) inside text and get them expand to
any value. This option can be given multiple times and every occurrance
of \s-1TAG\s0 is replaced with \s-1VALUE\s0. E.g. when given following options:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    --reference "#HOME-URL=http://www.example.com/dir"
\&    --reference "#ARCHIVE-URL=http://www.example.com/dir/dir2"
.Ve
.Sp
When referenced in text, the generated \s-1HTML\s0 includes expanded expanded to
values. An example text:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        The homepage is #HOME-URL/page.html and the mirrot page it at
\&        #ARCHIVE-URL/page.html where you can find the latest version.
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-reference\-separator \s-1STRING\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reference-separator STRING"
See above. String that is used to split the \s-1TAG\s0 and \s-1VALUE\s0. Default is equal
sign \*(L"=\*(R".
.IP "\fB\-\-Toc\-url\-print \-T\fR" 4
.IX Item "--Toc-url-print -T"
Display URLs (contructed from headings) that build up the Table of Contents
(\s-1NAME\s0 \s-1AHREF\s0 tags) in a document. The list is outputted to stderr, so that
it can be separated:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    % t2html.pl --Toc-url-print tmp.txt > file.html 2> toc-list.txt
.Ve
.Sp
Where would you need this? If you want to know the fragment identifies
for your file, you need the list of names.

.IX Subsection "Html: Controlling CSS generation (HTML tables)"
.IP "\fB\-\-css\-code\-bg\fR" 4
.IX Item "--css-code-bg"
This option affects how the code section (column 12) is rendered. Normally
the section is surrounded with a <pre>..</pre> codes, but with this
options, something more fancier is used. The code is wrapped inside a
<table>...</table> and the background color is set to a shade of gray.
.ie n .IP "\fB\-\-css\-code\-note ""\s-1REGEXP\s0"" \fR" 4
.el .IP "\fB\-\-css\-code\-note ``\s-1REGEXP\s0'' \fR" 4
.IX Item "--css-code-note REGEXP "
Option \fB\-\-css\-code\-bg\fR is required to activate this option. A special word
defined using regexp (defualt is 'Note:') will mark code sections specially.
The \f(CW\*(C`first word\*(C'\fR is matched against the supplied Perl regexp.
.Sp
The supplied regexp must not, repeat, must not, include any matching group
operators. This simply means, that grouping parenthesis like
\&\f(CW\*(C`(one|two|three)\*(C'\fR are not allowed. You must use the Perl non-grouping ones
like \f(CW\*(C`(?:one|two|three)\*(C'\fR. Please refer to perl manual page [perlre] if
this short introduction did not give enough rope.
.Sp
With this options, instead of rendering column 12 text with <\s-1PRE\s0>..</PRE>,
the text appears just like regular text, but with a twist. The background
color of the text has been changed to darker grey to visually stand out
form the text.
.Sp
An example will clarify. Suppose that you passed options \fB\-\-css\-code\-bg\fR
and \fB\-\-css\-code\-note='(?:Notice|Note):'\fR, which instructed to treat the
first paragraphs at column 12 differently. Like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    This is the regular text that appears somewhere at column 8.
\&    It may contain several lines of text in this paragraph.
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        Notice: Here is the special section, at column 12,
\&        and the first word in this paragraph is 'Notice:'.
\&        Only that makes this paragraph at column 12 special.
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Now, we have some code to show to the user:
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
\&        {
\&            //  Doing something in this loop
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
One note, text written with initial special word, like \f(CW\*(C`Notice:\*(C'\fR,
must all fit in one full pragraph. Any other paragraphs that follow,
are rendered as code sections. Like here:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    This is the regular text that appears somewhere
\&    It may contain several lines of text in this paragraph
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        Notice: Here is the special section, at column 12,
\&        and the first word in this paragraph is 'Notice:'
\&        which makes it special
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        Hoewver, this paragraph IS NOT rendered specially
\&        any more. Only the first paragraph above.
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
\&        {
\&            //  Doing something in this loop
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
As if this were not enough, there are some special table control
directives that let you control the <\s-1TABLE\s0>..</TABLE> which is
put around the code section at column 12. Here are few examples:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Here is example 1
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        #t2html::td:bgcolor=#F7F7DE
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
\&        {
\&            //  Doing something in this loop

\&        {
\&            //  Doing something in this loop

\&        for ( i = 0; i++; i < 10 )
\&        {
\&            //  Doing something in this loop
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Looks cryptic? Cannot help that and in order for you to completely
understand what these directives do, you need to undertand what elements
can be added to the <\s-1TABLE\s0> and <\s-1TD\s0> tokens. Refer to \s-1HTML\s0 specification
for available attributes. Here is briefing what you can do:
.Sp
The start command is:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    #t2html::
\&            |
\&            After this comes attribute pairs in form key:value
\&            and multiple ones as key1:value1:key2:value2 ...
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`key:value\*(C'\fR pairs can be:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    td:ATTRIBUTES
\&       |
\&       This is converted into <TD attributes>
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    table:ATTRIBUTES
\&          |
\&          This is converted into <TABLE attributes>
.Ve
.Sp
There can be no spaces in the \s-1ATTRIBUTES\s0, because the \f(CW\*(C`First\-word\*(C'\fR must
be one contiguous word. An underscore can be used in place of space:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    table:border=1_width=94%
\&          |
\&          Interpreted as <TABLE border="1" width="94%">
.Ve
.Sp
It is also possible to change the default \s-1CLASS\s0 style with word
\&\f(CW\*(C`tableclass\*(C'\fR. In order the \s-1CLASS\s0 to be useful, its \s-1CSS\s0 definitions must be
either in the default configuration or supplied from a external file.
See option \fB\-\-script\-file\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    tableclass:CLASS
\&               |
\&               Interpreted as <TABLE class="CLASS">
.Ve
.Sp
For example, there are couple of default styles that can be used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    1) Here is CLASS "dashed" example
.Ve
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        #t2html::tableclass:dashed
.Ve

.Vb 4

Convert file only if tag \f(CW\*(C`#T2HTML\-\*(C'\fR is found from file. This option

A suggestion: When you put binary links to your documents, add them with
space:

Then the program \fIdoes\fR check the http addresses. Users may not be

When links are checked periodically, it would be quite a rigorous to

save link checking time, the \*(L"ok\*(R" links can be cached into separate

links found that were not in the cache are checked. This should
dramatically improve long searches. Consider this example, where
every text file is checked recursively.

.IP "\(bu" 4
There are only \fItwo\fR heading levels in this style. Heading columns are 0
and 4 and the heading must start with big letter or number
.IP "\(bu" 4
at column 4, if the text starts with small letter, that line is interpreted
as <\s-1STRONG\s0>
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \s-1HTML\s0 <\s-1HR\s0> mark is added just before printing heading at level 1.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The headings are gathered, the \s-1TOC\s0 is built and inserted to the beginning
of \s-1HTML\s0 page. The \s-1HTML\s0 <\s-1NAME\s0> references used in \s-1TOC\s0 are the first 4
sequential words from the headings. Make sure your headings are uniquely
named, otherwise there will be same \s-1NAME\s0 references in the generated \s-1HTML\s0.
Spaces are converted into underscore when joining the words. If you can not
write unique headings by four words, then you must use \fB\-\-name\-uniq\fR

The basic rules for positioning text in certain columns:
.IP "\(bu" 4
Text at column 0 is undefined if it does not start with big letter or number
to indicate Heading level 1.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Text between colums 1\-3 is marked with <\s-1EM\s0>
.IP "\(bu" 4
Column 4 is reserved for heading level 2

Column 10 is reserved for <\s-1EM\s0> text. If you want to quote someone
or to add reference text, place the text in this column.

order dot\-comma. The \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR(comma) works differently if it is used in bullet
.Sp
A <P> is always added if there is separation of paragraphs, but when you are
writing a bullet, there is a problem, because a bullet exist only as long

\&\fBthis feature is highly experimental\fR. It is possible to embed
pure \s-1HTML\s0 inside text in occasions, where e.g. some special
formatting is needed. The isea is simple: you write \s-1HTML\s0 as usual
but double every < and > characters, like:
.Sp

.Ve
.Sp
The other rule is that all, let's repeat, \s-1ALL\s0 \s-1PURE\s0 \s-1HTML\s0 must be
